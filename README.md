eCommerce Data Science Assignment
This repository contains the code and deliverables for the eCommerce Data Science Assignment. The assignment is divided into three main tasks: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Lookalike Model, and Customer Segmentation using Clustering.

Tasks
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
Objective: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided eCommerce dataset and derive business insights.
Deliverables:
FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the EDA code.
FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf: PDF report containing 5 business insights derived from the EDA.


Task 2: Lookalike Model
Objective: Build a Lookalike Model that recommends 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
Deliverables:
FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv: CSV file containing the top 3 lookalikes and their similarity scores for the first 20 customers (C0001 to C0020).
FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb: Jupyter notebook explaining the model development.


Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Objective: Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques based on both customer profile and transaction information.
Deliverables:
FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf: PDF report on clustering results, including the number of clusters formed, DB Index value, and other clustering metrics.
FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the clustering code.


Dataset Files
Customers.csv: Contains information about the customers including CustomerID, Name, Region, and Signup Date.
Products.csv: Contains information about the products including ProductID, Name, Category, and Price.
Transactions.csv: Contains transaction details including TransactionID, CustomerID, ProductID, Quantity, TotalValue, and TransactionDate.
